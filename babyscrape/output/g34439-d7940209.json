Luis every day was full of joy & treated everyone the same & with a great smile. Breakfast was always good & the coffee bold & full of smooth excellent flavor. \nOur room was very clean & well equipped. Look forward to staying again.

        "review_text": "This has to be the worst stay I've had anywhere. First, check in is at 4pm but our room wasn't ready for us until nearly 6pm. We weren't alone as the lobby was full of countless others waiting even after ours was ready. Second, the front desk clerk told me my card would be authorized a total of $100 for a two night stay which is pretty standard. However, my card was authorized twice at $200 each. I was told DONT worry it'll fall off in 7 days! That's not the point. That's 4 times the amount I was advised, some folks might not have that type of flexibility with their cards. Third, I went from a top floor waterfront view with balcony on digital check in to a 5th floor room with only a view of ugly a/c units. Doors inside the room will not shut all the way, defeating the point of separate rooms. The entire evening (6pm until 1am+) has been filled with loud shouting, yelling, screaming, jumping, door slamming and wall banging. The front desk has apologized and promised to address the situation, yet things have only gotten louder and more out of control. So much for a relaxing beach trip, you won't get any sleep or peace here. They really don't care once you're stuck here.",

        "review_text": "Overall we principally enjoyed our stay at the Gates. The interior design was very beautiful and the staff at breakfast were very nice and accommodating.  \nWALKING: In general we were able to walk everywhere from the hotel, but it is a bit of a hike if you are trying to get to the southern part of ocean drive.... but all is doable....  \nBIKE RENTALS:  It states free two hours but the process to get the bikes is way too complicated, you need to download an app and then grab a voucher from the front desk, but the app doesn\u2019t really explain how to enter the voucher. Also the hourly rates are much higher than the city rates, which is not understandable to be honest.  We gave up and walked due to things getting so complicated.  Plus you have to download on separate phones to get each bike.\nBEACH Chairs:  Great option and always something available.  We enjoyed this option a lot.  Be aware - they don\u2019t come with umbrellas, so bring your own or pay there.\nPOOL Area:  Very green and beautiful.  Drawbacks - needs a good pressure wash + more often in the shade than not.  Please building being constructed next store which creates more shade now.  DJ was a great Touch for Friday\u2019s and Saturdays - wish there was more music like that during the week as well.  We loved the jacuzzi, nice view of channel next to the hotel.  Water was cold probably due to no heating and not being in the sun, but in warmer months I am sure it is fine (November was when we went.\nROOMS:  Unfortunately this was the biggest issue.  We booked a suite with balcony, but wasn\u2019t available when we got there - they gave us a regular king room and a discount which we appreciated.  We had to ask several times when they thought they would give us a room but communication was always difficult to get.  After spending one night in the King, we finally got our originally booked room.  This meant however we had to haul all of the things we brought (families unfortunately have a lot) to the other room which was difficult.  The lamp in the room had cigarette burns and looked like it was going to fall apart. \nHOUSEKEEPING:   One day we would have only one towel set for three people.  We asked for someone to come up and no one came. Two of the vents were completely covered in lint/dust and needed urgent cleaning.  We asked the front desk to have it taken care of and nothing ever happened (Room 828).  Worst part of all, the sheets had stain marks on them - they were clean but I do recommend to discard if they are still stained after washing - this should have been picked up by housekeeping.  We asked the front desk to change and they did, so we appreciated that.  Dirty glasses were not exchanged with new ones and we didnt receive new waters. Vacuuming was inconsistent.\nCheck in:  Overall ok, but when unloading our luggage etc, they came with two luggage carts you would find at an airport... we suggest to have more luggage carts available.\nBREAKFAST:   While we appreciated very much the breakfast being included it got old real fast - and they only offered \u201ctechnically\u201d one option - two eggs, fried potatoes and bacon.  I recommend strongly to mix things up for guests staying for full week as this was a challenge for us.  Great staff but just limited selection.  Also less could be more - plates were plentiful and had a lot on them which is a good thing but we felt also like it was a bit much.  Wait staff finally offered us to select from the other menu items which was great, offering our son simple cereal instead of the one choice and pancakes, which were amazing!\nOverall we had a good vacation but I think the little details were missing that would have made our stay not only good but excellent.  Hope these comments help the hotel to improve but don\u2019t deter people from staying - its still a good hotel.",
