We spent the day at Yosemite (only an hour and a half away from the hotel, another park!) and the check-in process took minutes and then we went out to eat at a diner that was only four minutes away! We got back to the hotel and immediately fell asleep after showering, the king size bed was SO comfy. We mentioned it was our honeymoon (one day honeymoon, my husband is military and had to get back to work) and they wrote us the SWEETEST note and had a little heart of towels on the bed. We are already planning when we can come back and already said we will stay here when we do! I absolutely recommend this place.",

Being a solo female traveler, safety and convenience are so important.  I came in at night and had a bit of trouble finding the place because the motel SIGN was NOT lit up but my gps got me there.  There\u2019s a busy Denny\u2019s actually IN the same corner lot, you can walk right over without even crossing a street. I felt safe during the short walk in the dark.  Only saw a Denny\u2019s employee taking a break, no homeless people mentioned in other reviews.  Lobby is bright and clean, sweet desk clerk girl very friendly and bright as well!  Room small but clean as a pin.  Well appointed, even a microwave which is often missing in these chain motels.  I\u2019ll definitely stay here again as needed to make travel convenient using Amtrak.",
